# Hello Markdown!

It  **so** nice to be able to write in this simple format.

Once you get the hang of *it*.

*Remember the basic syntax
*Write your doc
*Done!

Now you can be a wiz at this language and code up stuff like 'Console.WriteLine("Hello Markdown");'

Can't remember the language? No problem! Just visit one of these resources:
